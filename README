# Create-Agent-Skills-Folders

This project helps you create the folder structure for new vibecoding. You can use the skills already included here or add new skills to `.projectSkills/unskills`.

## Using skills

- In a new chat, trigger skills with: `/select-project-skills` (Claude Code) or `$select-project-skills` (Codex).
- Let the model help screen and choose the most suitable skills for your project.

## Managing skills

- Add skills: place the skill folder into `.projectSkills/skills`.
- Remove skills: move the skill folder from `.projectSkills/skills` to `.projectSkills/unskills`, or delete it.
